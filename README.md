# Advanced Coding Tools And Methodologies 2023/2024 - Project FM sequencer
The main project of ACTAM

We've crafted a two-channel sequencer/synthesizer with a percussive character. One channel is built on an FM engine (from tone.js), while the other is tailored to deliver drum sounds.

The standout feature of our instrument is the ability to tweak all sound parameters for each step, enabling musicians to create highly unpredictable lines.

Let's delve into the key functionalities, starting with the first track based on an FM engine.

## FM Synth Track
### Oscillator Section
Comprising a carrier and a modulator, you can select the waveform for both by clicking the respective arrows. For the carrier, you can also choose the frequency (quantized notes are available by toggling the vertical switch). Regarding the modulator, you can set its frequency with the harmonicity parameter (modulator frequency equals the carrier frequency multiplied by the harmonicity value). The modulation amount determines the modulator oscillator's amplitude.

### Amplitude Properties 
Define the attack and release of the sound in this section (designed for a percussive behavior). Below these controls are the LFO rate and amount knobs (the LFO modulates the modulator oscillator's amount parameter and can operate at audio rate, providing wild modulations and effects).

## Drum Track
This second channel is dedicated to drums (you can access it by clicking the smaller channel below the main sequencer and vice-versa to go back to the oscillator's channel), featuring four independent channels: kick, snare, tom, and hat. These can be played simultaneously for each step, with different volumes selectable for these four instruments, effectively creating a complete drum machine within a single channel.

### Kick
 Control over frequency, volume release, pitch envelope release, and pitch sweep amount (this parameter works in tandem with frequency release).

### Snare
Control over frequency, volume release, pitch sweep amount, and noise color (selectable between white, brown, and pink).

### Hat
Control over the cutoff frequency of a hipass filter (filtering white noise) and volume release.

### Tom
Control over frequency, volume release, and color (defining the amount of distortion on the sine tone).

### Common parameters
All these instruments share two parameters: pan position and gain.

### Global parameters
Additionally, you can select the global BPM. In the same section, you'll find controls related to play and stop, hear the selected step, and copy to all (copies the selected step's parameters to all steps).

## Sequencer and visual representation
The most significant aspect of our instrument is the flexibility to alter sound parameters for every step. To trigger a step, left-click it. If you wish to adjust step parameters, right-click it, and the knob positions will adjust based on the sound designed for that step. Then, you can freely modify the knob positions as desired.
For the visual representation, we opted to colorize each step based on its parameters for easy identification of the currently playing step. The hue is influenced by the oscillator's frequency, the color saturation is influenced by the oscillator's waveform, intensity is determined by the mod amount and harmonicity, lightness is affected by gain, and the circular crown dimension is influenced by the attack-release (AR) time.
For the drum section, each step contains four circular crowns representing the four percussive instruments. The intensity of each gray crown is determined by the gain of the respective instrument.

## Custom flanger unit
An additional noteworthy feature of our synthesizer is the custom flanger algorithm we've developed. This stereo flanger incorporates cross-feedback distortion, resulting in a potentially highly distorted sound. The parameters of this effect unit include:

- LFO Shape: Uncommon in typical flanger effects, this parameter influences the shape of the Low-Frequency Oscillator (LFO).

- LFO Rate: Determines the speed of the flanger, capable of reaching audio rates for a unique effect.

- Flanger Depth: Controls the sweep of the flanger by reducing the amplitude of the delay lines' outputs.

- Flanger Feedback: Influences the metallic quality of the flanger sound, interacting significantly with the color parameter.

- Flanger Width: Dictates the movement of the delay lines within the flanger.

- Flanger Dry/Wet: Adjusts the balance between the affected signal and the normal signal.

- Flanger Color: Governs the feedback distortion within the flanger.

- Flanger Stereo: Determines the stereo width of the sound.

These parameters collectively contribute to the versatile and unique sonic possibilities offered by our synthesizer's flanger effect.



## Custom folder/distortion unit
We've also crafted a distinctive effect â€“ a folder/distortion unit situated at the input of the flanger. The initial stage of this unit involves a folder that folds the input sounds a variable number of times, determined by the fold amount parameter. This process significantly enhances the harmonic content of the sound. Subsequently, the sound traverses through a distortion unit, the intensity of which can range from soft to extremely hard, depending on the distortion parameter. Note that the dry/wet only works on the distortion. In order to remove the folder simply set fold amount to the minimum value.
